## **My DSA Journey**

This repository documents my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey as part of my preparation for Java Backend Developer roles.

The goal of this repository is to build strong problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and core computer science foundations required for technical interviews and backend development.

## **Goal**

- Become interview-ready for Java Backend roles

- Improve DSA and logic-building skills

- Strengthen Core Java fundamentals

- Perform better in coding rounds

- Build consistency and discipline in problem solving

## **What This Repository Contains**

This repository will include practice and solutions for:

- Data Structures

- Algorithms

- Logic-based problems

- Core Java concepts used in DSA

- Interview-style coding questions

- The focus is on writing clean, logical, and interview-friendly solutions.

## **Tech Stack**

- Programming Language: Java

- Version Control: Git and GitHub

## **How to Run the Code**

Compile and run any Java file using:

javac FileName.java
java FileName

(Each file is independent.)

## **Learning Approach**

- Solve problems from scratch

- Focus on understanding logic

- Debug errors instead of skipping them

- Improve code structure and readability

- Learn concepts deeply before moving forward

## **Future Plans**

- Organize code topic-wise

- Add optimized solutions

- Include time and space complexity

- Add interview notes and explanations
